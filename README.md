SRT File parser in C. This program gets a srt file as a command line argument. The main purpose is to be able to change the time of the subtitles, entering a new value in **seconds**. 

Currently, the option 1 - "Parse" shifts the time, while creating a new file "Outfile.srt", with the updated time. The option 2 - "Print File" just prints the file, and 3 - "Exit" leaves the program.

# Usage

After building the executable "Clegend", the target file is inserted by passing as a reference in the command line:

````
// On Linux, passing the sample file in the src folder

[user@DESKTOP C-SRT-FileParser]$./clegend src/IronMan.srt
````
## Menu

````
Openning File : src/IronMan.srt

        1 - Parse
        2 - Print File
        6 - Exit
````
## Parse

````
1  // Chosen option

How many seconds to shift ? : 59
````
## Comparison IN and OUT files

````
// Input File

897
00:59:10,365 --> 00:59:12,591
No. No, absolutely not.
It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

// Output File

897
01:00:09,365 --> 01:00:11,591
No. No, absolutely not.

This code is a challenge made by my friend [Jose Rogerio](https://github.com/almeidajr).

# Notes 

- **(Fixed - Lists Removed)** The sequence List is a queue, where the first is always frist, and new members are put in the end of the list.(Last In First Out)
- **(Fixed - Lists Removed)** "first" pointer and "last" pointer keeps track of the data in their respective positions.
- **(Fixed - No dynamic allocation)** Memory is not reallocated, or liberated, Possible memory leak issue.

# To-do
- [X] Keep track of dynamic allocated variables - No Leaks or Runtime Errors, checked with Valgrind.
- [X] Implement Parsing function in the menu - Option 1.
- [X] Implement UpdateTime function - Got Called GhangeTimestamp.
